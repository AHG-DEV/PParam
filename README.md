# Introduction
PParam is a portable parameter definition framework for C++.

By PParam developer could define his parameter structure, and then easily convert it to XML/JSON or save in database and also load parameter from XML/JSON doc or database.

At now PParam supports conversion to/from XML and also have an experimental support of SQLite. 

PParam introduces a new method for designing object-oriented programs that is called XObject. XObject defines a real world as a set of objects and their connections. This method reduces design complexity and increases flexibility and stability of a system.

Any try to add more features to PParams is welcome.

# Installation
The first step is getting the lasted source and unzipt it. run this command to configure PParam for your system:
```shell
$ ./configure
```
NOTE: if the configure file does not exist, run ./autogen.sh script.
The next step is building the various binary files. So, enter:
```shell
$ make
```
Then login as root and run:
```shell
$ make install
```
That's all ;-)

Use pkg-config to discover the necessary include and linker arguments. For instance,
```shell
$ pkg-config libpparam-1.0 --cflags â€“libs
```
# Documentation
Our wiki contains several [tutorials](http://pdnsoft.com/en/web/pdnen/wiki/-/wiki/Main/PParam+Tutorial) on how to use PParam.
if you are looking for a more in-depth view of how PParam works, we recommend you to look at "sparam.hpp|cpp" files. We also put the "doxygen" output of PParam comments [here](http://support.pdnsoft.com/doxy/PParam)
If you have questions regarding the use of PParam  feel free to register and ask your question on [forum](http://pdnsoft.com/en/web/pdnen/forum/-/message_boards/category/423811). 
# PParam Roadmap
The roadmap of PParam is: 
* JSON support. 
* Attributes support in XML tags.
* Database support, PParam now has a limited support of "sqlite", so we want to have a complete DB layer, and support of different DBMS-es. By this feature, programmer could store/retrieve it's parameters in/from DB. 
* Develop more special parameters (see "sparam.hpp|cpp"). 

# Contributing Code
If you are capable of contributing code changes, we encourage you to do so. You can help us in different fields:
* Develop new features (see roadmap above)
* Testing and bug reports
* Improving Documentation
* ...
